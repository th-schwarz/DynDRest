DynDRest is a simple REST-service for dynamic DNS and is a more general variant of [DDAuto](https://github.com/th-schwarz/DDAuto). The basic idea is to have multiple implementations of different dns providers. [AutoDNS](https://www.internetx.com/en/domains/autodns) will be one of them.

The restful-api can be used with many routers, for example the AVM Fritz!Box.
DynDRest can be executed by `commandline`, `init.d` or `systemd`.

If you find a bug or certain features are missing, don't hesitate to file an issue on [Github](https://github.com/th-schwarz/DynDRest/issues).

## Big Picture

DynDRest is running as a service. A client can access the service via url and basic-auth. Let's assume DynDRest is running on `localhost`, then we can update the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the host _mydyndns.domain.com_ by calling the following curl command:
```bash
curl -u dyndns:test123 -i \ 
   "http://localhost:8081/update/mydyndns.domain.com/?apitoken=1234567890abcdf&ipv4=127.1.2.4&ipv6=2a03:4000:41:32::2"
```
For each host an api-token must be defined. If the api-token doesn't match the host, the update will be failed. Due to this security feature, DynDRest can be used by different people. They can't update the IPs each other.


## Setup & Configuration

DynDRest is a spring boot application, that's why the application is extremely customizable just by configuration! Details of the configuration can be found here: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#application-properties and https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#actuator.monitoring.customizing-management-server-port

> Side note: To avoid the use of the java keystore tool, DynDRest could be run behind a proxy. Corresponding headers are set by default.

### File Structure

Here is the suggested file structure:

```bash
├── /opt/dyndrest
│   ├── dyndrest.yml
│   ├── dyndrest-0.1.0.jar
│   ├── dyndrest.jar -> dyndrest-0.1.0.jar
│   ├── dyndrest-update.log   (log of the updates)
│   ├── logback.xml         (logback configuration for application and update logoging, optional)
│   ├── logback-update.xml  (extra logback configuration for update logging, optional include) 
```

**dyndrest.yml** defines the individual properties and will be merged with the default properties in the classpath, therefore the file can be kept as small as possible. A minimal configuration example can be found further below. If the file is inside the working directory, it is loaded automatically. The complete configuration setings can be found [here](https://github.com/th-schwarz/DynDRest/wiki/DynDRest-Configuration). <br>
Important: The basic-auth, the api-tokens and the credentials for AutoDNS should be defined in this file!

The configuration of Logback can be split into two files, one for the application logging (**logback.xml**) and one for a the well-formatted zone update log (**logback-update.xml**). The second one is the one on which the log view is based. <br>
For further information have look at the [Logback Configuration](https://github.com/th-schwarz/DynDRest/wiki/Logback-Configuration) wiki article.

### Start

The fully executable jar can be executed in different ways.

#### by Command Line

The start by command line looks like:
```bash
cd /opt/dyndrest/
java -jar dyndrest.jar --logging.config=logback.xml
```

#### by systemd Service

DynDRest can also be started easily as a systemd service. An example for the desired service configuration can be found at the wiki article [systemd Service Configuration](https://github.com/th-schwarz/DynDRest/wiki/systemd-Service-Configuration).

#### by init.d Service

Another possibility to start DynDRest is as `init.d` service. Further information can be found at the documentation of spring boot, [Installation as an init.d Service (System V)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment.installing.nix-services.init-d).

### Configuration example for the provider 'domainrobot'

This is a minimal configuration example for your individual properties file _dyndrest.yml_ using the provider _domainrobot_:
```yaml
spring:
  security:
    user:
      name: dyndns
      password: test123
      
dyndrest:
  provider: domainrobot

domainrobot:
  autodns:
    password: pwd_t
    user: user_t
  zones:
    - name: dynhost.info
      ns: ns.domain.info
      hosts:
        - myhost:1234567890abcdef
```
The 'zone' section defines a host ```myhost.dynhost.info``` with the api-token `1234567890abcdef`.

> This project uses _spring-doc_ to document the routes. The endpoints for this and the _swagger-ui_ are disabled by default!

## Routes

All routes are secured by basic-auth. A detailed description of the routes can be found at the [OAS3 documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/th-schwarz/DynDRest/blob/develop/docs/index.html).

There are two additional routes which deliver web pages:
* [/]: A simple greeting page which is enabled by default. It can be disabled by setting the property ```dyndrest.greeting-enabled=false```.
* [/log]: Delivers a simple web page to view the zone update logs and is secured by basic-auth and can be configured by setting the two properties ```dyndrest.update-log-user-name``` and ```dyndrest.update-log-user-password```. It is enabled by default but it can be disabled by setting the property ```dyndrest.update-log-page-enabled=false```.


## Suggested AutoDNS setup

For security reasons, it makes sense to create a separate owner for the zone updated by DynDRest. This owner just needs the permission for zone-info and zone-updates!


## Setup a router for dynamic DNS

As an example, let's have a look at the setup of dynamic DNS in the [Fritz!Box 7590](https://service.avm.de/help/en/FRITZ-Box-7530/019p2/hilfe_dyndns).
The following settngs are required:
* *DynDNS Provider:* User-defined
* *Domain name:* The hostname for which the IPs should be updated.
* *Username / Password:* The credentials for basic-auth.
* *Update-URL:* [your-host:port]/update/\<domain\>/?apitoken=[yourApitoken]&ipv4=\<ipaddr\>&ipv6=\<ip6addr\> <br>
  If both IP parameters are omitted, an attempt is made to fetch the remote IP.
