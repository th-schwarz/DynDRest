== Abstract

DynDRest is a simple REST-service for dynamic DNS and is a more general
variant of https://github.com/th-schwarz/DDAuto[DDAuto]. The basic idea
is to have multiple implementations of different dns providers.
https://www.internetx.com/en/domains/autodns[AutoDNS] will be one of
them.

The restful-api can be used with many routers, for example the AVM
Fritz!Box. DynDRest can be executed by `commandline`, `init.d` or
`systemd`.

If you find a bug or certain features are missing, don’t hesitate to
file an issue on https://github.com/th-schwarz/DynDRest/issues[Github].

DynDRest is kindly supported by

== Disclaimer

keyboards. This guide comes without any warranty!

== Big Picture

DynDRest is running as a service. A client can access the service via
url and basic-auth. Let’s assume DynDRest is running on `localhost`,
then we can update the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the host
_mydyndns.domain.com_ by calling the following curl command:

[source,console]
----
curl -u dyndns:test123 -i \
   "http://localhost:8081/update/mydyndns.domain.com/?apitoken=1234567890abcdf&ipv4=127.1.2.4&ipv6=2a03:4000:41:32::2"
----

For each host an api-token must be defined. If the api-token doesn’t
match the host, the update will be failed. Due to this security feature,
DynDRest can be used by different people. They can’t update the IPs each
other.

== Setup & Configuration

DynDRest is a spring boot application, that’s why the application is
extremely customizable just by configuration! Details of the
configuration can be found here in https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#application-properties[Appendix A: Common Application Properties] of the spring boot reference documentation.

====
To avoid the use of the java keystore tool, DynDRest could be run behind a proxy. Corresponding headers are set by default.
====

=== File Structure

Here is the suggested file structure:

[source,bash]
----
├── /opt/dyndrest
│   ├── dyndrest.yml
│   ├── dyndrest-0.1.0.jar
│   ├── dyndrest.jar -> dyndrest-0.1.0.jar
│   ├── dyndrest-update.log   (log of the updates)
│   ├── logback.xml         (logback configuration for application and update logoging, optional)
│   ├── logback-update.xml  (extra logback configuration for update logging, optional include)
----

*dyndrest.yml* defines the individual properties and will be merged with
the default properties in the classpath, therefore the file can be kept
as small as possible. A minimal configuration example can be found
further below. If the file is inside the working directory, it is loaded
automatically. The complete configuration setings can be found link:docs/dyndrest-configuration.adoc[here].
Important: The basic-auth, the api-tokens and the credentials for
AutoDNS should be defined in this file!

The configuration of Logback can be split into two files, one for the
application logging (*logback.xml*) and one for a the well-formatted
zone update log (*logback-update.xml*). The second one is the one on
which the log view is based. For further information have look at the
link:docs/logback-configuration.adoc[Logback Configuration] documentation.

=== Configuration example for the provider 'domainrobot'

This is a minimal configuration example for your individual properties
file `dyndrest.yml` using the provider _domainrobot_:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    user:
      name: dyndns
      password: test123

dyndrest:
  provider: domainrobot

domainrobot:
  autodns:
    password: pwd_t
    user: user_t
  zones:
    - name: dynhost.info
      ns: ns.domain.info
      hosts:
        - myhost:1234567890abcdef
----

The `zone` section defines a host `myhost.dynhost.info` with the
api-token `1234567890abcdef`.

====
This project uses _spring-doc_ to document the routes. The endpoints for this and the _swagger-ui_ are disabled by default!
====

==== Suggested AutoDNS setup

For security reasons, it makes sense to create a separate owner for the
zone updated by DynDRest. This owner just needs the permission for
zone-info and zone-updates!

== Start

The fully executable jar can be executed in different ways.

=== by Command Line

The start by command line looks like:

[source,bash]
----
cd /opt/dyndrest/
java -jar dyndrest.jar --logging.config=logback.xml
----

=== by systemd Service

DynDRest can also be started easily as a systemd service. An example for
the desired service configuration can be found at the wiki article
link:docs/systemd-configuration.adoc[systemd
Service Configuration].

=== by init.d Service

Another possibility to start DynDRest is as `init.d` service. Further
information can be found at the documentation of spring boot,
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment.installing.nix-services.init-d[Installation
as an init.d Service (System V)].

== Routes

All routes are secured by basic-auth. A detailed description of the
routes can be found at the
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/th-schwarz/DynDRest/blob/develop/docs/openapi/index.html[OAS3
documentation].

There are two additional routes which deliver web pages:

* [/]: A simple
greeting page which is enabled by default. It can be disabled by setting
the property `dyndrest.greeting-enabled=false`.
* [/log]: Delivers a
simple web page to view the zone update logs and is secured by
basic-auth and can be configured by setting the two properties
`dyndrest.update-log-user-name` and `dyndrest.update-log-user-password`.
It is enabled by default but it can be disabled by setting the property
`dyndrest.update-log-page-enabled=false`.

== Setup a router for dynamic DNS

As an example, let’s have a look at the setup of dynamic DNS in the
https://service.avm.de/help/en/FRITZ-Box-7530/019p2/hilfe_dyndns[Fritz!Box
7590]. The following settngs are required:

* _DynDNS Provider:_
User-defined
* _Domain name:_ The hostname for which the IPs should be
updated.
* _Username / Password:_ The credentials for basic-auth.
* _Update-URL:_
[your-host:port]/update/<domain>/?apitoken=[yourApitoken]&ipv4=<ipaddr>&ipv6=<ip6addr>
If both IP parameters are omitted, an attempt is made to fetch the
remote IP.
