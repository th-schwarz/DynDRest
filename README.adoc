== Preface

DynDRest is a simple REST-service for dynamic DNS. The basic idea
is to have multiple implementations of different dns providers.
https://www.internetx.com/en/domains/autodns[AutoDNS] will be one of
them. +
DynDRest is based on spring boot 3, that's why Java 17 or later is required!

The restful-api can be used with many routers, for example the AVM
Fritz!Box. DynDRest can be executed by `commandline`, `init.d` or
`systemd`.

If you find a bug or certain features are missing, don’t hesitate to
file an issue on https://github.com/th-schwarz/DynDRest/issues[Github].

This project is also a playground for the author to try things out. That's why not all changes are really necessary to move the project forward!

== Disclaimer

I’m not responsible for any data loss, hardware damage or broken
keyboards. This guide comes without any warranty!

== Big Picture

DynDRest is running as a service. A client can access the service via
url and basic-auth. Let’s assume DynDRest is running on `localhost`,
then we can update the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the host
_mydyndns.domain.com_ by calling the following curl command:

[source,console]
----
curl -u dyndns:test123 -i \
   "http://localhost:8081/update/mydyndns.domain.com?apitoken=1234567890abcdf&ipv4=127.1.2.4&ipv6=2a03:4000:41:32::2"
----

For each host an api-token must be defined. If the api-token doesn’t
match the host, the update will be failed. Due to this security feature,
DynDRest can be used by different people. They can’t update the IPs each
other.

== Setup & Configuration

DynDRest is a spring boot application, that’s why the application is
extremely customizable just by configuration! Details of the
configuration can be found here in https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#application-properties[Appendix A: Common Application Properties] of the spring boot reference documentation.

NOTE: To avoid the use of the java keystore tool, DynDRest could be run behind a proxy. Corresponding headers are set by default.

=== File Structure

Here is the suggested file structure:

[source,bash]
----
├── /opt/dyndrest
│   ├── dyndrest.yml
│   ├── dyndrest-0.7.0.jar
│   ├── dyndrest.jar -> dyndrest-0.7.0.jar
│   ├── logback.xml    (logback configuration)
│   ├── dyndrest.mv.db  (h2 database file)
│   ├── /backup
│       ├── dump.sql   (optional backup of the database)
│   ├── /restore
│       ├── dump.sql   (optional dump of the database to restore)
│   ├── /log
│       ├── dyndrest.log   (application log)
----

*dyndrest.yml* defines the individual properties. The file is read by default and
will be merged with the default properties in the classpath, therefore the file can be kept
as small as possible. A minimal configuration example can be found
further below. If the file is inside the working directory, it is loaded
automatically. The complete configuration settings can be found link:docs/dyndrest-configuration.adoc[here]. +
Important: The basic-auth, the api-tokens and the credentials for
AutoDNS should be defined in this file!

*logback.xml* is the configuration file of Logback.

=== Minimal configuration example

This is a minimal configuration example for your individual properties
file `dyndrest.yml` using the provider _domainrobot_:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    user:
      name: dyndns
      password: test123

  datasource:
    username: dba
    password: secretpwd

logging:
  config: file:./logback.xml

dyndrest:
  provider: domainrobot

domainrobot:
  autodns:
    password: pwd_t
    user: user_t

zones:
- name: dynhost.info
  ns: ns.domain.info
  hosts:
    - myhost:1234567890abcdef
----

The `zones` section should be used for importing the hosts and zones configuration to the database initially. Existing data entries won't be updated. The example defines a host `myhost.dynhost.info` with the api-token `1234567890abcdef`.

NOTE: This project uses _spring-doc_ to document the routes. The endpoints for this and the _swagger-ui_ are disabled by default!

=== Backup and Restore of the Database

There are 2 very basic configurations:

- Backup: A cron-triggered service to dump the database regular.

- Restore: Very basic strategy, if _restore_ is enabled and the file `./restore/dump.sql` exists at start, the dump will be restored and the file renamed to `./restore/dump.sql.bak`.

Or further info, see <<docs/dyndrest-configuration.adoc#backup_restore, Backup & Restore>>

=== Suggested AutoDNS setup

For security reasons, it makes sense to create a separate owner for the
zones updated by DynDRest. This owner just needs the permission for
zone-info and zone-updates!

== Start

The fully executable jar can be executed in different ways.

=== by Command Line

The start by command line looks like:

[source,bash]
----
cd /opt/dyndrest/
java -jar dyndrest.jar --logging.config=logback.xml
----

=== by systemd Service

DynDRest can also be started easily as a systemd service. An example for
the desired service configuration can be found at the documentation
link:docs/systemd-configuration.adoc[systemd
Service Configuration].

=== by init.d Service

Another possibility to start DynDRest is as `init.d` service. Further
information can be found at the documentation of spring boot,
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment.installing.nix-services.init-d[Installation
as an init.d Service (System V)].

== Routes

All routes are secured by basic-auth. A detailed description of the
routes can be found at the
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/th-schwarz/DynDRest/blob/develop/docs/openapi/index.html[OAS3
documentation].

There are additional routes:

* [/]: A simple html greeting page which is enabled by default. It can be disabled by setting
the property `dyndrest.greeting-enabled=false`.
* [/manage/health]: A very simple health check with an extra basic-auth user. It can be enabled and configured by setting `management.endpoint.health.enabled=true` and the both properties `dyndrest.healthcheck-user-name` and `dyndrest.healthcheck-user-password`.
* [/log-ui]: Delivers a  simple web page to view the zone update logs. It is secured by
basic-auth and can be configured by setting the two properties
`dyndrest.update-log-user-name` and `dyndrest.update-log-user-password`.
It is enabled by default, but it can be disabled by setting the property
`dyndrest.update-log-page-enabled=false`.

== Setup a router for dynamic DNS

As an example, let’s have a look at the setup of dynamic DNS in the
https://service.avm.de/help/en/FRITZ-Box-7530/019p2/hilfe_dyndns[Fritz!Box
7590]. The following settngs are required:

* _DynDNS Provider:_
User-defined
* _Domain name:_ The hostname for which the IPs should be
updated.
* _Username / Password:_ The credentials for basic-auth.
* _Update-URL:_
[your-host:port]/update/<domain>?apitoken=[yourApitoken]&ipv4=<ipaddr>&ipv6=<ip6addr>
If both IP parameters are omitted, an attempt is made to fetch the
remote IP.
